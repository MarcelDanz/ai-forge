# Rules

> *The laws of the codebase -- universal truths every line of code must obey.*

The `rules/` directory defines the **core principles, patterns, and constraints** that all code _must_ follow. These rules are enforced by both human reviewers and AI agents. They form the foundation of consistency, quality, and technical vision.

---

## What belongs here:

- Fundamental principles (e.g. purity, immutability, separation of concerns)
- Naming and formatting conventions
- Approved design patterns and idioms
- Architectural boundaries and layering constraints
- Language-specific style guides
- Hard constraints: “never do this”, “always do that”

---

## Related Directories

- See `recipes/` for working code examples that demonstrate these rules.
- See `workflows/` for practical procedures where these rules _must_ be applied.

---

## Guidelines

- Be specific and concise with your wording.
- Write in a way that a junior developer can understand the instructions
- Make the rules measurable wherever possible
- Give examples for valid and invalid application of the rules
