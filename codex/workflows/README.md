# Workflows

*Step-by-step procedures for building, changing, and maintaining the project.*

The `workflows/` directory provides **clear, repeatable instructions** for how to perform common development tasks in alignment with the `rules/` and guided by the `lore/`.

These workflows are meant to be followed by:
- Human developers during daily work
- AI agents executing high-level requests

Each workflow should answer:  

> *"How do I do this the right way, without violating the Codex?"*

---

## Examples

- `create-prd.md` -- How to create top-level documentation for feature requirements.
- `generate-tasks.md` -- How to create meaningful tasks from feature descriptions.

---

## Guidelines

- Be **specific and reproducible**
- Link to any relevant `rules/` that must be respected
- Reference `recipes/` where example code can help
- Update if process changes â€” workflows are living documents
- Write in a way that a junior developer can understand the instructions
