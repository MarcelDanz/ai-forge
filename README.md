# ai-forge
A simple language agnostic framework to turn your vanilla coding assistant into a true software developer.


## Feature description

I created this project as a framework to share ai coding assistents between my software projects. 

1. I want to be able to copy the folders `codex`, `lore`, and `saga` through a cli command to a new project. Then the coding assistant I use in that project can use these code conventions, workflows etc. and I don't need to do it manually. 
2. Additionally I want to be able to update the `codex` folder in an existing project with the newest version of the folder from the framework project. I want to do this also with a cli command. 
3. And last I want to use a third cli command to push changes to the `codex` folder from my new projects to the framework. This will come in handy when I find new rules the ai assistant should follow while developing the new projects. Then I want an easy way to push these new rules to the framework.
