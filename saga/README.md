# Saga

> *The story of how the product is being built -- chapter by chapter.*

This directory documents the path we walk as developers. It contains all task descriptions, task breakdowns, and timelines. 
It captures not just what we intend to do, but also what we've done so far.

## Contents

- `roadmap.md` -- Whatâ€™s coming up
- `tasks-prd-my-feature.md` -- Task and sub-task descriptions for each feature.

## Guidelines

- Write in specific, concise sentences.
- The target audience for the documents in this directory are junior developers.
- Be technical -- let the reader know all relevant technicalities.
- Reference every resource and file that might be relevant for the implementation.
