# Lore

> *The why and what behind the product -- the vision and goal we are building toward.*

The `lore/` directory contains the **product’s narrative, context, and intent**. While the `codex/` defines how we build and the `saga/` tells the story of building, the lore is about **what we’re building and why**. And the files in this directory build the single truth of this **what**.

It is the space for:

- Vision and goals
- personas and user journeys
- Feature briefs and requirements
- Problem definitions and use cases
- Outcomes and success criteria

The lore sets the direction for the saga. It grounds our work in real needs, shared understanding, and purpose. When we get confused where we are going with a specific task we check the lore to realign.

## Suggested Files

- `vision.md` -- The high-level direction and intent of the product
- `personas.md` -- Who we are building for, and what they care about
- `feature_overview.md` -- Key product capabilities and goals
- `prd-my-feature.md` -- One Product Requirements Document for each feature to be build.

---

## Guidelines

- Keep entries clear, concise, and human-focused.
- Write for non-technical users.
- Prefer use cases, examples, and motivation over technical details (those live in the `codex/` and the `saga/`).
- Lore is living so update these files when the project evolves.
- Cover all aspects and requirements of this project.
